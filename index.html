                            Wendy's offers a solid fast-food experience with their signature square patties. The fries
                            are
                            decent, though not always as hot or crispy as they should be. Service speed can vary
                            depending on
                            the time of day. Overall, Wendy's is a reliable choice when you want something tasty and
                            affordable. It is open 24/7, and its located nearby campus.
